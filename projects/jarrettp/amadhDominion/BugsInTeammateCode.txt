Bug Name:  Adventurer segmentation fault

Bug Description:  The adventurer card exhibits strange behavior due to the way variables are
passed to it, particuraly the cardDrawn variable.  Because cardDrawn is within the card effect
function and then passed into the nested play_adventurer function, some very odd behaviors happens
within the two 

The card seems to perform well on the first iteration of the while loop to draw treasure and breaks
out of the loop correctly.  Subsequent loops give unpredictable results but when random testing is used
over a large number of iterations, the card will eventually produce a segfault (filling the player hand
with a nonseical value and running out of memory).


Bug Name:  Adventurer "discard" bug
Description: When a non-treasure card is drawn, it is added to the temp hand, but the last card drawn is not
removed (using state->handCount[currentPlayer]--).  Thus the player hand keeps getting filled and leads to 
unexpected results.   The bug above overshadows this behavior but both of these should be addressed.
